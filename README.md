Learning Objectives

Being able to group various HTML elements together and then lay them out in the document correctly is a key aspect to web development. This assignment will give you some practice with the concepts we've learned around layouts with CSS.

Your Mission

Recreate the design below in HTML and CSS. Each Box represents a user on GitHub and a couple of their projects, feel free to use any other user or project you can find there. You should use the profile images from GitHub.

Note that some of the design elements below are for harder modes!

GitHub users layout
How to Submit
You should have two files: your HTML and your CSS.

Create a NEW repository on GitHub
Clone that repository to your local machine
Be sure to commit FREQUENTLY - I want to see MANY commits on a REGULAR basis
Submit your GitHub repository URL to the assignment here on newline
Adventure Mode

The only images should be the user's picture. (So what are the dots next to the languages?)
Deploy your site on GitHub pages.
EPIC Mode

Make sure this site looks good on mobile and tablet sized screens as well.
On mobile sizes, there should only be one user per row
On mobile sizes, the user profile box should extend almost all the way across
On tablet sizes, only two users should be in each row
